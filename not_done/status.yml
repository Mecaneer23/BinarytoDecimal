In progess:
    erlang

Not feasible (yet):
    porth
        (language needs to be further along/have documentation to be able to work effectively)
    LOLCODE
        (the language may not be able to do what I am asking of it)
    pigeon
        (Brian Will language - I don't have a way to run it)
    haxe
        (I am really confused with running it - it doesn't seem that complicated to write though)
    neko
        (there is no looping construct?)
